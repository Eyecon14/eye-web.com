        <h2>The Journey of Programming</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>1940s-1950s: The Birth of Computers and Assembly Language</h3>
            <p>The origins of programming are closely tied to the development of electronic computers. In the 1940s, pioneers like Alan Turing and John von Neumann laid the theoretical groundwork for computation. The first practical electronic computers were programmed using low-level machine languages and assembly languages.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1950s-1960s: The Emergence of High-Level Languages</h3>
            <p>As computers became more powerful and widespread, the need for more efficient and human-readable programming languages arose. Fortran, COBOL, and ALGOL were introduced, contributing to the abstraction of programming concepts.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>1960s-1970s: The Rise of Mainstream Languages</h3>
            <p>In the 1960s, languages like BASIC and PL/I aimed to make programming more accessible. In the early 1970s, C programming language was developed at Bell Labs, becoming a powerful and influential language.</p>

        <!-- Include additional sections for each era -->

        <h2>Recent Trends: Machine Learning, Data Science, and DevOps</h2>
        <p>In recent years, languages like Python and R have become dominant in the fields of data science and machine learning. DevOps practices have led to the popularity of infrastructure-as-code languages like YAML and domain-specific languages for automation.</p>
